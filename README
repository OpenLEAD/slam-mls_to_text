This package only creates a mls_to_text command line tool. It expects an envire
environment and the ID of a MLS as input, and outputs a text representation
with:

the first line being

   OFFSETX SCALEX OFFSETY SCALEY
   
followed by one line per MLS Y-major line, of the form

   YBEGIN y_coord [CELLBEGIN x_coord y_coord [H z_mean z_stddev|V z_mean z_height]+]*

where the blocks starting with H represent a horizontal patch and the blocks
starting with Z a vertical one
